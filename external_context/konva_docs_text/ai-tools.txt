Coding with Konva and AI agent​ We have several AI tools that may help you build better konva apps. All of them are powered by awesome crawlchat. AI agent will use Konva docs exensevly to answer your questions. Please remember it is an LLM and as any modern LLM it may give wrong answers. AI chat bot​ Click "Ask AI" button somewhere on the page to ask a question to AI. You can also join your Discord community and ask @AiBot-CrawlChat there. MCP​ MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a standard protocol to connect with LLM applications like Claude App, Cursor, Windsurf or more such applications. Cursor MCP Command​ For clear video instructions take a look into this guide. Cursor needs a JSON snippet to be added to the Cursor settings. Copy and paste the following snippet. Important: as of March 2025, cursor will use MCP only in "Agent" mode. "Ask" and others will not use it.
