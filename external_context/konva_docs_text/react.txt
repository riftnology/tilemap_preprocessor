React - KonvaJS Documentation
=============================

Source: https://konvajs.org/docs/react/index.html

react-konva is a JavaScript library for drawing complex canvas graphics using React. It provides declarative and reactive bindings to the Konva Framework. Github Repo It is an attempt to make React work with the HTML5 canvas library. The goal is to have a similar declarative markup as normal React and also a similar data-flow model. Currently, react-konva is not supported in the React Native environment. Currently you can use all Konva nodes and shapes as React components and all Konva events are supported on them in the same way. Note: you can find a lot of demos and examples for using Konva at https://konvajs.org/. Really, just go there and take a look at what Konva can do for you. You will be able to do the same with react-konva, too. Konva for react-konva is like DOM for React. Installationâ€‹ npm install react-konva konva --save Here's a basic example showing how to create a simple canvas with some shapes: import React from 'react'; import { Stage, Layer, Rect, Circle, Text } from 'react-konva'; const App = () => { return ( <Stage width={window.innerWidth} height={window.innerHeight}> <Layer> <Text text="Try to drag shapes" fontSize={15} /> <Rect x={20} y={50} width={100} height={100} fill="red" shadowBlur={10} draggable /> <Circle x={200} y={100} radius={50} fill="green" draggable /> </Layer> </Stage> ); }; export default App; Open on CodeSandboxOpen Sandbox
